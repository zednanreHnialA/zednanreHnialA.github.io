### CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 4

    I liked lab 4 part 2 because one of my friends made something similar in high school. 
    In this lab I learnt about if statements and how to check for conditions of variables. 
    I also learnt the uses for nesting if statements which could be useful for having 
    questions that might have multiple answers. 

* Lab 6

    I liked lab 6 part 1 because it gave more functionality to the command line. This lab 
    taught me how to turn the command line inputs into variables. This lab also taught me 
    how to check for valid command line arguments and proper command line size.
